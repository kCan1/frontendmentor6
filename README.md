### My Process
---
1. Set up project with Vite and React  
2. Implement mobile-first layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid  
3. Integrate Google Fonts and custom properties for typography  
4. Add interactive states (hover/focus) for buttons and links  
5. Test responsiveness across breakpoints  
6. Built components part by part and imported them using recommended React methods  
7. Practiced Flexbox skills learned from Flexbox Froggy

### Built With
---
- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Mobile-first workflow

- Vite

### Tech Stack
---
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with custom properties)  
- React (functional components)  
- Vite (build tool)  
- Flexbox & CSS Grid  
- Responsive units (rem, em, %, clamp)

### What I Learned
---
- Responsive design patterns with CSS Grid and Flexbox  
- Managing state and props in React components  
- Building accessible and interactive UI elements  
- Fast development workflow with Vite  
- Structuring semantic HTML for clarity and SEO  
- Building components modularly and importing them as recommended in React docs

### Challenges & Solutions
---
I struggled with block CSS techniques and importing Google Fonts. Overcame both by researching official docs and hands-on experimentation. I'm also proud of building the UI by breaking it into components and using React's recommended import/export patterns. Practicing Flexbox with Flexbox Froggy helped a lot with layout challenges.
